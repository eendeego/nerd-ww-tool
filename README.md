# Nerd Weight Watcher Tool

Watch your weight on your desktop via Nerd Tool.

This project fetches data from [True Weight](http://www.madeupsoftware.com/trueweight/home.html),
plots it via [D3](http://d3js.org/) to SVG.

This SVG is then rasterized via ImageMagick or Batik (later gives best results.)

Note: ImageMagick and/or Batik must be installed separately.

The final png image can be shown by [Nerd Tool](http://mutablecode.com/apps/nerdtool.html).

# Automatic updates

Use crontab (via `crontab -e`) to install `bin/cron-update.sh`.

# Other usages

This project uses D3 in node in a not so standard fashion, namely, it tricks d3/jsdom
into generating a document that can be saved later on (see [lib/chart.js](lib/chart.js)).

The same technique can be used to extract the DOM tree generated by D3, this can
be extremely useful for unit testing.
